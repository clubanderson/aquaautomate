# Getting Started with AquaAutomate

Welcome! Whether you're setting up your first fish tank or you're a Home Assistant pro looking to automate your aquarium — you're in the right place.

## Who Are We?

We're a husband-and-wife team combining two passions:

- **Fish expertise** — species care, aquascaping, water chemistry
- **Home automation** — Home Assistant, Tuya, Lutron, smart monitoring

The result? A shop and guide site that helps you build an **automated aquarium** — where your tech takes care of the routine stuff so you can enjoy your fish.

## What You Can Do Here

### 1. Shop Products
We sell aquarium products from **Danbury Aquarium** (a trusted local shop in Danbury, CT) alongside curated **Amazon automation gear**. Every product is tagged with compatibility info so you know what works together.

### 2. Follow Automation Blueprints
Step-by-step guides with **copy-paste Home Assistant configs** to automate:
- Lighting schedules (sunrise/sunset)
- Temperature monitoring and alerts
- Water quality dashboards
- Feeding automation
- Scene control with Lutron Pico remotes

### 3. Learn Fish Care
Species care guides with water parameters, tank mate compatibility, and automation tie-ins.

## Your First Automated Tank (Budget Build)

Here's what we recommend for your first automated freshwater tank:

| Item | Price |
|------|-------|
| 10-gallon tank + hood | ~$30 |
| Hygger LED Light | ~$33 |
| Tuya Smart Plug (4-pack) | ~$25 |
| Sponge filter + air pump | ~$15 |
| Heater (50W) | ~$15 |
| Substrate + basic hardscape | ~$20 |
| Neon Tetras (school of 6) | ~$12 |
| **Total** | **~$150** |

Add a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant (~$50) and you've got a fully automated tank for about $200.
