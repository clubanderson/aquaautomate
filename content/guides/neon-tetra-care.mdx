# Neon Tetra Care Guide

The **Neon Tetra** (*Paracheirodon innesi*) is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish — and for good reason. Their iridescent blue and red stripes look incredible under the right lighting, they're peaceful, hardy, and perfect for beginners.

## Quick Facts

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Scientific Name** | Paracheirodon innesi |
| **Size** | 1.5 inches (3.5 cm) |
| **Lifespan** | 5-8 years |
| **Temperature** | 70-81°F (21-27°C) |
| **pH** | 6.0-7.0 |
| **Minimum Tank** | 10 gallons |
| **School Size** | 6+ (more is better) |
| **Difficulty** | Beginner |

## Water Parameters

Neon Tetras prefer **soft, slightly acidic water**:

- **Temperature**: 70-81°F (ideal: 74-76°F)
- **pH**: 6.0-7.0
- **Hardness**: 2-10 dGH
- **Ammonia/Nitrite**: 0 ppm (always)
- **Nitrate**: Below 20 ppm

**Pro tip**: Use a Tuya water quality sensor + Home Assistant to monitor these parameters 24/7 and get alerts on your phone.

## Tank Mates

Neon Tetras are peaceful community fish. Good tank mates include:

- Corydoras Catfish
- Harlequin Rasboras
- Cherry Shrimp
- Otocinclus
- Dwarf Gouramis
- Cardinal Tetras

**Avoid**: Angelfish (will eat neons), large cichlids, aggressive species.

## Feeding

Feed 1-2 times daily, only what they can eat in 2 minutes:

- High-quality micro pellets or flake food
- Frozen or freeze-dried brine shrimp (1-2x per week)
- Frozen daphnia (great for color)

**Automation idea**: Use a smart auto-feeder on a Home Assistant schedule. Set up vacation mode with slightly reduced feeding.

## Lighting

Neon Tetras prefer **moderate to low lighting**. Their colors actually pop more with dimmer lights against a dark background. A Hygger Full Spectrum light on a sunrise/sunset schedule is perfect.

## Common Issues

### Neon Tetra Disease (NTD)
- Symptoms: White patches, faded colors, erratic swimming
- Cause: *Pleistophora hyphessobryconis* parasite
- Treatment: No cure — quarantine and remove affected fish immediately

### Fin Rot
- Symptoms: Ragged, deteriorating fins
- Cause: Poor water quality + bacterial infection
- Treatment: Fix water quality first, then medicate if needed

## Automate Their Environment

Set up Home Assistant to keep your neons happy automatically:

```yaml
# Temperature Alert for Neon Tetra Tank
automation:
  - alias: "Neon Tank Temp Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.aquarium_temperature
        above: 82
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🐟 Tank Alert"
          message: "Neon Tetra tank is {{ states('sensor.aquarium_temperature') }}°F — too warm!"

  - alias: "Neon Tank Temp Low Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.aquarium_temperature
        below: 68
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🐟 Tank Alert"
          message: "Neon Tetra tank is {{ states('sensor.aquarium_temperature') }}°F — too cold!"
```
